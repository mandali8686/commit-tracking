Magento_Sales: This modules mainly deals with sales management, which includes order processing. Any files related to order status or draft status might potentially be altered.\n\n2. Magento_Quote: This module handles cart operations before order is placed (Drafts). So files responsible for maintaining the status of the cart might be affected.\n\n3. Magento_Checkout: It deals with checkout process, including transitioning a quote (draft) into an order.\n\n4. Magento_Cron: If the issue is concerning the timely update or expiry of draft states, the scheduled tasks files within this module might be changed to rectify the issue.\n\nIn any case, to identify exact file(s) which will be changed, detailed examination of system or error logs and code review needs to be done."
